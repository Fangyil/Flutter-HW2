      intro:
          "Belle is a fictional character in Walt Disney Pictures' animated film Beauty and the Beast (1991). Voiced by actress and singer Paige O'Hara, Belle, the book-loving daughter of an eccentric inventor, yearns to abandon her predictable village life in return for adventure. When her father Maurice is imprisoned by a cold-hearted beast in an enchanted castle, Belle offers her own freedom in exchange for her father's, and gradually learns to love the Beast despite his outward appearance.\nDisney chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg commissioned Beauty and the Beast as an animated musical with a strong heroine, for which he hired first-time screenwriter Linda Woolverton. Basing her on the heroine of the 1740 fairy tale of the same name, Woolverton adapted Belle into a more proactive character for the film, deliberately conceiving her as a feminist to curtail criticisms Disney had long received for purportedly portraying female characters as victims. Inspired by the women's rights movement and actress Katharine Hepburn's performance in the film Little Women (1933), Woolverton created Belle as a unique departure from previous Disney heroines, particularly The Little Mermaid's Ariel. However, some story artists often contested Woolverton's liberated vision for the character. Animated by James Baxter and Mark Henn, the former of whom based the character's graceful gait on those of impressionist Edgar Degas' ballerinas, Belle's European facial features were inspired by those of British actresses Vivien Leigh and Audrey Hepburn. Several additional Hollywood actresses inspired Belle's appearance, including Natalie Wood, Elizabeth Taylor, and Grace Kelly. Disney auditioned 500 candidates for the role, before casting O'Hara based on her mature-sounding voice and Broadway experience.\nBelle has garnered widespread acclaim from film critics who appreciated the character's bravery, intelligence, and independence. Reception towards her feminism, however, has been more mixed, with commentators accusing the character's actions of being romance-oriented. The fifth Disney Princess, Belle is often ranked among the franchise's best members. Highly regarded as one of Disney's strongest examples of a feminist character, critics agree that Belle helped spearhead a generation of independent film heroines while changing the reputation of a Disney princess. Also one of Disney's most iconic characters, Belle was the only animated heroine nominated for the American Film Institute's greatest heroes in film ranking. The character also appears in the film's several sequels and spin-offs, as well as her own live-action television series. American actress Susan Egan originated the role of Belle in the Broadway musical adaptation of the film, for which she was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical. Emma Watson played Belle in the 2017 live-action adaptation of the film.",

            "The Beast is a fictional character who appears in Walt Disney Animation Studios' animated film Beauty and the Beast (1991), as well as in the film's two direct-to-video followups Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas and Belle's Magical World. Based on the hero of the French fairy tale by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont, the Beast was created by screenwriter Linda Woolverton and animated by Glen Keane.\nA pampered prince transformed into a hideous beast as punishment for his cold-hearted and selfish ways, the Beast must, in order to return to his former self, earn the love of a beautiful young woman named Belle whom he imprisons in his castle. All this must be done before the last petal falls from the enchanted rose on his twenty-first birthday. In all animated film appearances, the Beast is voiced by American actor Robby Benson. The 1991 animated film was adapted into a Broadway musical in 1994, with the role being originated by American actor Terrence Mann. Dan Stevens portrays a live-action version of the character in the 2017 adaptation of the 1991 film."),

      intro:
          "Gaston is a fictional character in Walt Disney Pictures' animated film Beauty and the Beast (1991). Voiced by American actor and singer Richard White, Gaston is an arrogant and ruthless hunter whose unrequited feelings for the intellectual Belle drive him to murder his adversary, the Beast, once he realizes she cares for him instead. Gaston serves as a foil personality to the Beast, who was once as vain as Gaston prior to his transformation.\nGaston is a character original to Disney, as he is not present in the Beauty and the Beast fairy tale by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont upon which the 1991 film is based. Imagined by screenwriter Linda Woolverton, who based the character on the ex-boyfriends she dated in her past,[citation needed] Gaston was developed specifically for Disney's adaptation of Beauty and the Beast because the studio felt that the film could benefit from a strong villain, who is lacking in the original fairy tale. As the character evolves from a non-threatening aristocrat into an arrogant man relentlessly seeking Belle's hand in marriage, Gaston ultimately replaced a female relative of Belle's who the filmmakers had originally created to serve as the film's villain.\nIn direct contrast to his adversary the Beast, Gaston is depicted as physically handsome with an unattractive personality, both physically and emotionally embodying hypermasculinity. Both Disney and supervising animator Andreas Deja initially struggled with the concept of animating a handsome villain, which had never been attempted by the studio before. Deja ultimately based Gaston's appearance on those of handsome soap opera actors in order to create a grotesque version of the Prince Charming stock character, while some of White's own operatic mannerisms were incorporated into the character.\nGaston has been generally positively received by film critics, as his lack of 'magic power or political influence' means that his villainy tends to resonate with audiences who often identify someone similar to him in real life, although critics regard him as a less memorable villain than some of the studio's previous efforts. Considered to be one of Disney's most famous villains, Gaston is frequently ranked within the top-tens of Disney villain rankings released by several media publications.",

          "Maurice is the village inventor and Belle's father. However, most of the villagers think he is insane for crafting devices believed ridiculous and impossible to construct in reality.\nDuring the beginning of the movie, he is working on a machine that automatically chops up firewood. Once it is successfully working, he leaves for the County Fair to display his invention. However, he is unable to make it to the fair due to getting lost in the woods. After going down a path that results in the loss of his horse and cart, and being attacked and nearly killed by a pack of rabid wolves, he winds up at the gate of a dark castle. When he enters the castle to stay for the night, he ends up being locked up by the Beast, the castle's master.\nBelle learns of what happened and goes to the castle, attempting to release her father. She then tries to convince the Beast to release him from the castle. She succeeds in convincing the Beast to release him, under the condition that she is to take her father's place, to Maurice's protests. Maurice is forcibly taken back to the village.\nUpon returning to the village, Maurice tries to seek the villagers' help in trying to rescue Belle, but they don't believe him, and they consequently throw him out of the tavern.\nDetermined to not give up on Belle, he decides to return to the castle alone. However, it doesn't take long before he succumbs to an unknown illness due to the cold weather. Luckily, Belle discovers that her father is in trouble via the Beast's Magic Mirror and is released by the Beast so she can save him. Shortly after arriving back home, Le Fou has alerted the villagers of their return. Shortly thereafter, Monsieur D'Arque, the keeper of the Maison de Lunes Insane Asylum, and the other villagers come to take Maurice to the insane asylum in an intricate plan to blackmail Belle into marrying Gaston. Belle reveals that Maurice's rants are true and that the Beast does exist. Both she and Maurice are locked up by Gaston in the cellar, to stop them from interfering with Gaston's goal to kill the Beast. Chip has managed to stow away in Belle's satchel and uses the automated firewood cutter to destroy the door to the cellar. Maurice and Belle leave for the castle to stop Gaston from killing the Beast. He is last seen in the ballroom standing by Mrs. Potts as he happily watches Belle and the Beast (who is now transformed back into a handsome prince) dance while he laughs at Chip's question to his mother whether he still has to 'stay in the cupboard'.",

He allows Maurice to come into the castle to stay. Later, he and Cogsworth lure Belle to Maurice in hopes that she will break the spell. He suggests that the Beast try and move her to a better room. Lumi√®re tries to help the Beast become more civil for Belle, and sometimes rebels against the Beast if it suits the other characters' needs (like allowing Belle to have dinner despite Beast's refusal to let them feed her). Later, after the Beast rescues Belle from more wolves, and Belle nurses the Beast back to health, earning his affections in the process, Lumi√®re, aware of what would impress such a voracious reader, astutely suggests that the Beast give Belle the castle's immense library as a gift, which has the desired effect. He also tries to help the Beast learn how to do the waltz. He is initially upset that Belle leaves the castle, but he remains optimistic at the same time, since he's still convinced that she'll break the spell. When he discovers that the castle is going to be invaded by Gaston's lynch mob, he plans the battle. He then decides to set up a trap where all of the furniture is in the foyer, and he gives the signal to attack. While he is unable to stop Gaston from deserting the battle to kill the Beast, Lumi√®re rescues Fifi the Featherduster from being plucked apart by one of Gaston's friends and is earlier himself rescued by Cogsworth from Lefou. He, Cogsworth, and Mrs. Potts rush to aid the Beast who is fighting against Gaston, but arrive after the battle's end, when the Beast dies from a mortal wound from Gaston, who fell to his death from the West Wing. The spell breaks, however, reviving the Beast as a human and returning Lumi√®re and the others to their original forms.

When the Beast arrives, he tries to explain what happened, but the Beast is too angry to hear what happened. He tries to get Belle to come to dinner, but she refuses. When he reports to the Beast her refusal, he tries desperately to calm him down, as well as keep him calm when trying to get her to join him for dinner. He follows the Beast's orders to deny her dinner, but he eventually relents, telling them to at least keep the noise down. He is eventually swept up in the boisterous 'Be Our Guest' number. Later he learns that the Beast let Belle go, much to his dismay. He then tells everyone the bad news, and seems resigned to his fate (as the rose is nearing the last petal). When the residents of the castle learn of the upcoming invasion, he tries to come up with a plan to stop the villagers, but the others leave him before he can finish.

      intro:
          "Forte is the composer of the castle and serves as the main antagonist of The Enchanted Christmas. During a Christmas party, Forte plays his latest song to the Prince which is criticized. When the Enchantress curses the Beast, he is transformed into a pipe organ. Unlike the other cursed servants, he enjoys his new form because of the power it grants him, as he feels that he's more useful to the Beast in this form than he was in his human form. As such, he intends to sabotage the Beast and Belle's relationship to ensure that the spell is never broken. He also uses Fife the Piccolo to carry out his plan, promising him his own musical solo when he succeeds (though he never actually intends to give the solo to him). He tries to lure Belle away from the castle to get a Christmas tree in an area beyond a frozen lake and get her killed. While she's away, Forte tells the Beast that Belle has abandoned him, thus increasing Beast's anger. He then proceeds to tell the Beast to destroy the Enchanted Rose, but the Beast ultimately decides not to when a rose petal lands on the storybook from Belle, thus allowing the Beast to regain his senses.\nEnraged at this failure and refusing to 'fade away', he decides to destroy the entire castle with his music, as the Beast and Belle can't fall in love if they are both dead. He ultimately meets his end when the Beast rips out his keyboard and wrecks it, causing Forte to try to kill the Beast by lunging at him. He ends up being dislodged from the wall causing Forte to crash to the ground.",

This leads to the other servants, particularly Lumiere and Cogsworth, to dislike him greatly. During the first segment of Belle's Magical World, he infuriates the Beast by giving unwanted synonyms to Belle's insults during a row leading the Beast to strike him. Wracked with guilt after Belle and the Beast stop speaking to each other, he forges a letter of apology from Belle with his two best friends Crane and LePlume. He is exiled from the castle when the Beast finds out, but amends are made after Belle brings him back.",

As a result, when he tries to play, he makes the occasional sour note due to the cavities in his teeth, but struggles through the pain in hopes of returning to his human form and reuniting with his wife.\nWhen the villagers raid the castle, Cadenza takes part in the fight where he bodyslams LeFou and fires his remaining keys as a form of hailing bullets at the villagers but not long before Lumi√®re scares the villagers off by lighting one of the gunpowder puddles on the castle floor causing it to spark and forcing the villagers to retreat in humiliation. When the spell is broken, Cadenza is finally reunited with Garderobe and gets his lost teeth replaced. He performs his music at the ball at the end of the movie.",
